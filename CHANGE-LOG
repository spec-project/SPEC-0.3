Version 0.2
-----------
- 23/01/13:
* Migrated to the syntax of Bedwyr 1.4.
* Type checking is now built into Bedwyr, so typecheck.def is no
  longer needed.
* Changed slightly the syntax of 'let' construct to conform with
  the original syntax of spi-calculus.
* Various changes in the parsing of spi expressions. They are now
  parsed into the intermediate term structure of Bedwyr 1.4.
* Added a command to enable/disable reflexivity checking.
* Added a command to enable/disable trace printing.

Version 0.1.2
-------------
- 21/08/11: 
 * [spi.def] 
   Fix a minor problem in the operational semantics (spi.def). 
   The original specification of spi-calculus does not allow
   vacuous new binders in a concretion.
   For example, the following (new x\ con a (a<x>.0)) should
   be simplified to (con a (nu x\ a<x>.0)). 
   This is achieved by adding a new predicate called 'push_new'.

 * [bisim.def]
   Since the freshly generated names in concretions in a first
   process in a bisim pair is unrelated to the second process,
   we can use two distinct names. This turns out to reduce
   the table size, as it allows equivariant tabling to freely
   rename the fresh names in each process independently of
   the others. Note that variables names 
   are still shared so equivariant tabling will still keep
   a consistent renaming of these variables across both
   processes. See the predicate bisimAgent in bisim.def.

 * [term.ml, system.ml, prover.ml] 
   Add a new function to check that two terms are equivalent modulo
   renaming. Add a predicate '_eqvt' to invoke this function from
   the bedwyr interface.

 * [bisim.def]
   Add reflexivity checking. Because the fresh names in the first
   process and the second process are unrelated, to increase chance
   of success, one needs to do comparison modulo renaming.
   To do this, we use the _eqvt predicate above. 
   Note that we also need to make sure that the bi-trace themselves
   are equivariant. This simple checking is quite effective to rule
   out trivial pairs, e.g., in the Denning-Sacco-Lowe example, it reduces
   the number of bisim pairs by half.

   NOTE: Note that object-level variables are also
   encoded using nabla, so may be subject to renaming. But this is not a problem
   as long as the bitrace is consistent, which is always the case. 


 * Work in progress: adding a hash constructor

- 23/08/2011:
 * Added a general way of setting options. Introduced a unary predicate
  '_option'. 
  Clauses encoding various options will be added or retracted dynamically
  by the SPEC interface, through the command #set.
  For example,

  #set trace on;

  will add the clause

  _option trace.

  to the current session, whereas 

  #set trace off;

  will remove the clause (_option trace) if it's already present in the session.

  The Bedwyr programs can now test various settings by testing 
  _option predicate. 

  Currently we have 2 options: trace and reflexive. The latter is used to
  decide whether or not to use bisim upto reflexive checking.


 * Fixed a bug in the 'simplify' procedure in 'proc.def'. 
   The simplification for 'case' and 'let' was wrong. 

- 24/08/2011:
 * Remove the _trace flag. It's subsumed by _option predicate. Also take this out from
   the main Bedwyr module and make it only local to SPEC.

- 02/09/2011:
 * Add asymmetric encryption, hash, signature to the spi parser.
