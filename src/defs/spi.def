% This implementation uses the definition of the operational semantics
% by Abadi and Gordon. See the following paper for details
%   
%   Martin Abadi and Andrew Gordon. "A calculus for cryptographic protocols:
%   The spi calculus". Information and Computation 148, 1 - 70 (1999)
%
%  
% For simplicity, in this implementation we use only the encryption 
% constructor and pairing; natural numbers constructors are not implemented.
% But it is easy to add them.

% Message terms
Kind tm type.
Kind name type.

Type ct	(string -> tm). % constants
Type var	(name -> tm). % variables 
Type nm	(name -> tm). % names
Type bn	(tm -> tm).   % constructor for marking bound names; needed when recursing over binders. 
Type en	(tm -> tm -> tm). % symmetric encryption
Type pr	(tm -> tm -> tm). % pairing constructor

% Currently not used: 
% Type zz		tm. % zero
% Type succ	(tm -> tm). % successor
% Type hs	(tm -> tm). % hash function 
% Type aen	(tm -> tm -> tm). % asymmetric encryption 
% Type pub	(tm -> tm). % public key constructor
% Type sign	(tm -> tm -> tm). % signature
% Type vk	(tm -> tm). % verification key

% process constructors
Kind proc type.
Type zero proc.

Type match tm -> tm -> proc -> proc.
Type inp tm -> (tm -> proc) -> proc.
Type outp tm -> tm -> proc -> proc.
Type bang proc -> proc.
Type case tm -> tm -> (tm -> proc) -> proc.
% e.g., [case L of {x}_k in Px] is translated to (case L k (x\Px)).
Type let tm -> (tm -> tm -> proc) -> proc.
%   e.g., [let (x,y) = M in Pxy] becomes (let M (x\y\Pxy).

% NOTE: there is a danger that the symbolic transition produced
% will miss some instances if the binder appears statically as an
% argument of a logic variable.
% For example, if we have a symbolic process such as
% nu y. a<X y>.0
% where X is a logic variable of a functional type. 
% Then the pattern unification (y\ X y) = (y\ N) will succeed
% and the first _if branch gets executed while the second _if branch
% never does. So in this case a potential trace is excluded, i.e.,
% the case where X is the identity function. 
% This pathological case is ruled out if the input process, on
% the left side of the transition, does not contain a logic variable
% that is applied to statically bound names. This is the case
% in the application of bisimulation considered here, since we always
% start with ground processes. And transition always preserves
% this property of not having a logic variable statically applied to
% internal bound names of processes. 

% push the outermost vacuous new binder in a concretion into processes
