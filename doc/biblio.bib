                  techniques from concurrency theory, in order to
                  apply them to problems concerning the supervisory
                  control of discrete event systems. The main
                  ingredients of this approach are the
                  characterization of controllability in terms of (a
                  variant of) the notion of bisimulation, and the
                  observation that the family of (partial) languages
                  carries a final coalgebra structure. This allows for
                  a pervasive use of coinductive definition and proof
                  principles, leading to a conceptual unification and
                  simplification and, in a number of cases, to more
                  general and more efficient algorithms. <br>",

  abstract={We give a framework for the analysis of concurrent
constraint programming (ccp) which is based on simple denotational
semantics that approximates the usual semantics. Existing denotational
semantics for ccp are not a very suitable basis for analysis as, in
order for the semantics to model the observables exactly, complicated
structures such as sequences or trace operators are required. This
complexity makes it difficult to formalize analyses and prove their
correctness. In fact, for the purpose of analysis, this complexity is
often unnecessary as analyses necessarily approximate the underlying
semantics in the sense that they must lose information. This suggests
that we can base analyses on simpler semantics which need not be
correct in the classical sense, but only in the sense that they are
correct approximations. Here we propose several simple denotational
semantics based on input-output relations or functions as a basis for
analysis. These semantics, although not correct in a classical sense,
correctly approximate the standard operational model. Using these we
develop a generic analysis framework in which an analysis is specified
simply by giving a description domain and several operations on it.
Such analyses can be easily and efficiently implemented using standard
techniques from the analysis of logic programs as our denotational
semantics is similar to the semantics underlying logic program
analysis.}

  abstract={Higher-order patterns (HOPs) are a class of lambda-terms
    which behave almost like first-order terms w.r.t. unification:
    unification is decidable and unifiable terms have most general
    unifiers which are easy to compute. HOPs were first discovered by Dale
    Miller and subsequently developed and applied by Pfenning and Nipkow.
    This paper presents a stepwise development of a functional unification
    algorithm for HOPs. Both the usual representation of lambda-terms with
    alphabetic bound variables and de Bruijn's notation are treated. The
    appendix contains a complete listing of an implementation in Standard
    ML.}

The "logical" version of definitional reflection as used in the
extended logic programming language GCLA and the "$\omega$"-version
of definitional reflection as proposed by Eriksson and Girard.  The
logical version is a Left-introduction rule completely analogous to
the Left-introduction rules for logical operators in Gentzen-style
sequent systems, whereas the $\omega$-version extends the logical
version by a principle related to the $\omega$-rule in arithmetic.
Correspondingly, the interpretation of free variables differs between
the two approaches, resulting in different principles of closure of
inference rules under substitution. This difference is crucial for the
computational interpretation of definitional reflection.}

                  connectives defined by finite automata on infinite
                  words. We consider three different logics,
                  corresponding to three different types of acceptance
                  conditions (finite, looping and repeating) for the
                  automata. It turns out, however, that these logics
                  all have the same expressive power and that their
                  decision problems are all PSPACE-complete. We also
                  investigate connectives defined by alternating
                  automata and show that they do not increase the
                  expressive power of the logic or the complexity of
                  the decision problem.",
